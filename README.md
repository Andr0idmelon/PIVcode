# PIVcode
Here is the example code and part of raw data provided for the "Deep Learning Framework for Velocity Field Reconstruction from Low-Cost PIV Measurements."

The "model" folder contains the network architecture and training strategies of the model.

The "dataset" folder includes part of the dataset used for model training.

The "image" folder contains the raw particle images collected during the low-cost PIV experiments.

The "demo" folder contains an end-to-end prediction model based on Python, which is still a work in progress but functions well.

# PIVcode
Here is the example code and part of raw data provided for the "Deep Learning Framework for Velocity Field Reconstruction from Low-Cost PIV Measurements."

The "model" folder contains the network architecture and training strategies of the model.

The "image" folder contains the raw particle images collected during the low-cost PIV experiments.

The "demo" folder contains an end-to-end prediction model based on Python, which is still a work in progress but functions well.

Due to the large size of the dataset, it cannot be uploaded on GitHub. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. But the portion of the dataset used for model training can be obtained through email upon reasonable request.
